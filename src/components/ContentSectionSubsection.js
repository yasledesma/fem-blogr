        Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you focus
        on one thing: creating content. The editor supports management of
        multiple blogs and allows easy manipulation of embeds such as images,
        videos, and Markdown. Extensibility with plugins and themes provide easy
        ways to add functionality or change the looks of a blog.
